If you’re truly innocent, you should just tell us.
No matter how bad it probably is, it’s not worse than being convicted of murder, is it?
Why don’t you just say it?!
        

Here’s what’s going to happen: You will tell me everything you saw or suspect.
If you don’t, then just remember: Yes, you are an easy target.
And the judge will jump at the chance of closing a case early.
