
Emil: Oh, it was so very trivial. I didn’t think it count.
It’s hardly even a lie. I must’ve come back looking for something.
Something so trivial, in fact, that I forgot about looking for it.
        

You : Oh, really? I have a hard time believing that.
If it took you a considerable amount of time
then you either had to look for it thoroughly or was not ‘trivial’, as you say.
Either way, you’d remember the thing.


You know, you really shouldn’t lie. Even the best lawyers won’t be able to defend you, then.
A lawyer doesn’t go to prison for their client. Once you lie, you’re on your own.
So think rationally, and do not lie.
