You call Aarushi in
#################################

Aarushi Chauhan, a 25-year-old chartered accounted at Bar & Bench Legal Services, a somewhat successful law firm.

She comes in calmly and without hesitation and sits coolly opposite you, facing you directly.

You : So, Ms. Chauhan, I’ll get right to the point. Where were you at the time of the murder?

Aarushi : I must’ve been writing my emails. You may check my mail; I sent two at around 7:50 and 7:55.
