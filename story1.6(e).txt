
Emil : I’m sorry. I guess I’m just paranoid.
Please, do ask whatever you have to.
    

You : Thank you. Seeing your reaction,
I guess you and Mr. Alok were pretty close?


Emil : Yes, we were. He was one of my best friends.
We shared nearly everything with each other.


You : So, do you suspect anyone?


Emil : No I don’t. I still don’t understand how someone could do such a thing.
It’s inhumane! Especially to Alok. He was one of the best people I’ve ever met.
I was going through a hard time recently and he helped me get over it
as we were kind of in the same boat.


Though, Aarushi does seem a tiny bit suspicious. I’m not pointing fingers,
but even though she and me get along pretty well, she always seems a bit… off.
But I guess that’s just her nature. Everyone’s different, no?
