
You : I see. In the sub inspector’s notes, it says you saw Mr. Alok last at 7:45 this morning.
Could you care to elaborate? As in how you know the exact time.


Aarushi: Surely. I had set a reminder for 7:45 to forward the finance lists to Akshat, the CFO
of Bar and Bench. I got the reminder,
and he said 'hi' a few seconds after and went back to sleep.


You : I see. Now tell me, how were your relations with the deceased?


Aarushi: Fairly well. But why would you want to know that?
If you’re suspecting me then I must remind you that I work in a law firm.
I’ve already contacted Adv. Soham, the chief advocate at Bench; 
so, mind that before accusing me.


You : Nobody’s accusing you, Ms. Talwar. It’s just that…


What do you ask?
