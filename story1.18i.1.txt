
You : I believe you. But still, we should investigate it some more.


Suspicion Levels:
Aarushi+1


You : Anything else?


Sadya: There was a faint smell of nail polish when we entered the room.
We did not find any in this room, so it probably belonged to one of the girls.
    

You : Aarushi’s nail polish is old; I saw that (there were scratch marks).
Meanwhile Emil’s nails were recently polished; there was some on the skin 
around her nails. It was definitely Emil’s polish that you guys smelt.
She was here.
    

Sadya: But does it have anything to do with the murder?
what do you say?
