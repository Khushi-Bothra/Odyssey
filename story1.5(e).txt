You call Emil in
#################################


Emil Ray, a 24-year-old IT manager at Pharma-B, a pharmaceutical MNC.


She comes in a bit hesitantly, a bit out of balance, even.
She doesn’t move her eyes steadily,  but her head to look around.
She tries not to and does not blink. She clearly is on the verge of crying.
    

You : Ms. Ray, please get a hold of yourself. This must be hard for you,
but we need your help to catch whoever did this. Please, have a seat.


Emil: Oh, you don’t say… you’re questioning me.
I’m a suspect, aren’t I? God, no!
I did not do it, I swear! Please, you must believe me! 
You must…

    
You : Madam, please, calm down. Nobody’s suspecting anyone right now.
We just need to ask you a few questions so that our job gets easier.
