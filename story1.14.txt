Nayan: There’re no nail marks around the wound. The victim did 
struggle (he kicked his blanket) yet he did not try to pull the rod 
away or even fight the killer? Victim’s palms are red around a 
near-central area so that means there was pressure being applied 
on them, possibly with knees. Killer was thus either heavy or had a 
considerably high lower body strength.
    

Sadya: Well, Nachiket is… heavy.


You : Come on, you can say ‘fat’.
Anyway, you think it’s him?
