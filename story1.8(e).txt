There’s almost nothing you could’ve done.
Now, when did you leave and come back to this house again?
    

Emil: Well, I went in my friends’ carpool to go to my office.

You : Well, that’s funny now, isn’t it?
I have been comparing the timelines for clearity and seems like between
you leaving the house and coming back, there's a large gap.
There's also some circumstantial evidence that says you came back.
I am fairly certain you did not stop in between your path to the friends' car to introspect, did you?
    

So, the question arises:
(What do you ask?)
