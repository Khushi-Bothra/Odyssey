I mean, why in the world would I even come back? That’s absurd!
            

You : Well, the witnesses say otherwise. And I’m pretty sure when we compare timelines, they’d say the same.
So why don’t you save us both time and energy and tell us the truth?


You shouldn’t lie, you know. Even the best lawyers won’t be able to defend you, then.
A lawyer doesn’t go to prison for their client. Once you lie, you’re on your own.
And once you have the mark of a liar, even if you tell the truth
people will be hesitant to believe you.
So think rationally, and do not lie.
