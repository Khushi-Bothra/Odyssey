Nayan is right. She does have intense psychological issues.
Apparently Alok was constantly derogatory towards her. 
One day she had had enough and decided to kill the root 
of her issues, Alok. She saw Nachiket making tea, Emil not at home,
and an opportunity too good to miss out.
        

Sub-inspector : Then how was she in the bathroom?
You Probably killed him after Emil left the house before her leaving the bathroom.
Arrest her on the suspicion of murder and we'll see after that
