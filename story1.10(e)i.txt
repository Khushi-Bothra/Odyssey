
Emil: …ok, I went back for Aarushi. She sometimes self-harms
and those days she could get dangerous to others as well as herself.
On my way to the car I thought I realised she had SH marks on her wrists.
My phone was charging with a power bank so I couldn’t call home
and thus I rushed back to make sure she was ok.
        

When I came back I noticed the bathroom door closed
and there was a draft of an email on her computer.
As long as she keeps her mind distracted, she’s ok.
I was already getting late so rushed back to the car as Aarushi was ok for now.
I swear that’s the truth. I didn’t tell you as you’d think she killed him
because of her mental health issues. But trust me, she’s incapable of… 
killing someone in cold blood.

Aarushi+1


You : You seemed a bit hesitant there, Ms. Ray.
Seems like you yourself aren’t so sure about her. Anyway, that’s for us to decide.

You : Ok, that’s all. You may leave.
