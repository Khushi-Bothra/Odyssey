You call Nachiket in
#################################


Nachiket Mukund, a 25-year-old mathematics teacher for higher secondary classes at St. Jude’s High School, a nearby convent school.


He comes in completely shook. He’s sweating profusely.
He sits on the bed you point.
    

Nachiket: Look… I know how bad this looks. He and I shared a room and now he’s dead.
But I’m just an ordinary schoolteacher, that too of mathematics!
    

You : That’s… not a valid… Anyway, nobody’s accusing you right now.
So, you say you were in the kitchen, making tea while listening to music on your headphones.
Since when do you have that habit?
