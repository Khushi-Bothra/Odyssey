Emil: No. Not at all. I know him. He’s incapable of doing such a thing.
Also, look how nervous he is. He’s obviously scared that you’d presume he did it.
But who knows? Even the nicest ones do the most unbelievable things.
    

You : You described Mr. Alok as ‘a bit shaken’ yesternight? What’s that all about?


Emil: Yeah… he looked quite nervous. I did ask him about it later;
but he shook it off, saying it’s nothing. He probably knew… oh my god!
What have I done? I could’ve saved him! Oh no!
