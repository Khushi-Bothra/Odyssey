
You : Thank you. See, now, that wasn’t hard, was it?


Nachiket : Anything else?


You : Yes. When and how did you find out Mr. Alok was dead?


Nachiket : After I added the tea leaves to the boiled water and covered the thing, I went to wake up Alok.
He had a mark on his throat. I realised something was wrong and checked his breath and then pulse.
Then, I realised he was dead.
    

You : Thanks. That’s it for now. You may leave.
