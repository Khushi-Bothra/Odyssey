The body is on one of the two narrow beds. There are two cupboards, one of them ajar.


You go to the body.

This was where he was strangled; probably broke his larynx.
There was dried up blood and mucus that came out of his nose.


The CSI head, Sadya, and her junior, Nayan, (both of them your friends) come to you.
