Even if I weren’t remotely close to Alok, I’d say it’s him.

You : And why’s that, may I ask?

Aarushi : It’s clear as day, isn’t it? Alok and I shared a flat.
Nachiket and him shared a room.
He had more chance than anyone to kill him. When I was going to the washroom,
I saw Emil leave for office; I heard her close the door and lock it.
Who does that leave? Nachiket. Moreover, look how nervous is he! It all fits!
