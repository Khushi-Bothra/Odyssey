
Nachiket: Ok, I’ll say! It’s Emil!
When I was making tea, the kitchen had no windows open
except the one directly right to the stove.
It was only open a little. And whenever someone opens the gate,
the stove’s fire flickers a bit because of the air pressure thing.
If Emil only left as usual, it would’ve flickered once. But today, it flickered thrice.
Aarushi says she was in the bathroom. I was in the kitchen.
So, Emil went out, came in, and went out again with significant amount of time in
between the latter two. She also has a strong motive:
Her now-ex cheated on her with Alok about a month and a half ago.
She probably still blames him for ruining her three year-long relationship.
