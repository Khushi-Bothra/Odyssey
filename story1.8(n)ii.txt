all three of us has a motive each to kill Alok.
All of us were on good terms, yes, but still.


Aarushi has anger management issues and,
quite frankly, she may or may not have manic depression.
And Alok makes (made) really insensitive jokes about her.


Emil’s ex cheated on her with Alok a month and a half ago.
They were still best of friends after, yes; but she probably still 
blames him for ruining her three-year long relationship.


As for me, I’ve applied for a job as an associate professor of mathematics,
his job, at the uni he taught.
Him being dead makes it easier for me to get the job.
