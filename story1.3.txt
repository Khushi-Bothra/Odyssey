You enter the 2 BHK flat. Alok Ranjan, an associate professor of mathematics,

was discovered dead in his bed at 8 AM.

The sub inspector has made arrangements already.

The forensic team is in the room where it happened.

The sub inspector took the liberty of interrogating the 

neighbour, Shusmita Avasthi and recording the roommatesâ€™ statements.

Nachiket, one of the roommates, discovered the body at around 8 AM.

Aarushi, another roommate, greeted Alok at 7:45 AM and was in her room 

since except once when she went to the washroom for a considerate amount of 

time in which someone might have entered, murdered Alok, and left.

You could see no lock-picking marks on the lock outside and all the keys were in 

so the killer was one of the roommates.
